NaldoA â€” Site completo (ready)

Files:
- index.html
- css/style.css
- js/script.js
- images/*  (contains your uploaded logo/studio/radio images if available)

What to do next:
1) Open this folder in VS Code.
2) Replace js/script.js VIDEO_IDS array with the exact YouTube IDs of all your videos (the assistant couldn't auto-extract them). Each ID is the text after 'watch?v=' in the YouTube URL.
3) Test by opening index.html (or use Live Server in VS Code). The radio stream is already set to https://stream.zeno.fm/xx785t45mf9uv in js/script.js.
4) If you want me to embed the exact YouTube IDs for you, paste the list of links/IDs here and I'll rebuild the ZIP.

If anything isn't right, tell me exactly what to change and I'll update it.
